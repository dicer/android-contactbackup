Usage
==================================================

Target Audience
-----------------------------
 This application is primarily
 meant for users who want to
 retrieve a machine-readable
 format of the contacts stored
 on the device. The resulting
 file can be used to read the
 contacts into other
 applications.

 In addition to creating a
 machine-readable file, the
 application also provides the
 option to read a file with an
 identical format, thereby
 replacing the contacts on the
 device with those contained
 in the file. This can
 effectively be used as
 backup/restore solution, but
 this application is not meant
 as a backup solution and as
 such does not provide any
 guarantee that it will be fit
for that purpose

 If the acronym JSON does not
 mean anything to you or you
 don't do software development
 then this application may not
 be for you. Please take that
 into consideration before
 voting it down!

Creating a dump file
-----------------------------
 Click on the button labelled
"Save to file".  This will
create a file called
'contacts.json' on the
external storage device
(SDCard).

Loading a dump file
-----------------------------
 First, place a file called
 "contacts.json" onto the root
 folder of the SDCard, next
 open the application and
 click on the button labelled
 "Load from file".

 While loading, the
 application does not know how
 many contacts are contained
 in the file as it is streamed
 into the contact list. As
 such, the progress indicator
 displays the number of
 characters read from the file
 instead of the number of
 contacts.

Rationale
-----------------------------
 I am having trouble syncing
 my contacts with google. As
 it seems to be working for
 everyone else, I can only
 assume that one or more
 contacts cause problems.
 That is why I needed a tool
 to export my contacts. That
 way I can manually edit them,
 re-import them onto the phone
 and then retry syncing.

 On the other hand this gives
 me a much friendlier format
 to work with, so I can clean
 up my contacts.
