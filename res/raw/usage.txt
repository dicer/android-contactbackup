Usage
==================================================

   Remember that you accepted
   the risks that come with
   using this application!

Creating a dump file
-----------------------------
   Click on the button
   labelled "Save to file".
   This will create a file
   called 'contacts.json' on
   the external storage device
   (SDCard).

Loading a dump file
-----------------------------
 First, place a file called
 "contacts.json" onto the root
 folder of the SDCard, next
 open the application and
 click on the button labelled
 "Load from file".

 While loading, the
 application does not know how
 many contacts are contained
 in the file as it is streamed
 into the contact list. As
 such, the progress indicator
 displays the number of
 characters read from the file
 instead of the number of
 contacts.
