Disclaimer
-----------------------------
 When restoring, this
 application replaces the
 contacts currently stored on
 your phone with those in the
 loaded file. If the file
 contains errors or is corrupt
 in any way, then there is a
 high risk of losing data!

 By using this application you
 accept this as your own risk.
 The developer(s) will not
 take any responsibility for
 lost data.

Target Audience
-----------------------------
 This application is primarily
 meant for users who want to
 retrieve a machine-readable
 format of the contacts stored
 on the device. The resulting
 file can be used to read the
 contacts into other
 applications.

 In addition to creating a
 machine-readable file, the
 application also provides the
 option to read a file with an
 identical format, thereby
 replacing the contacts on the
 device with those contained
 in the file. This can
 effectively be used as
 backup/restore solution, but
 this application is not meant
 as a backup solution and as
 such does not provide any
 guarantee that there will be
 no data loss.  Please read
 the disclaimer above!

 If the acronym JSON does not
 mean anything to you or you
 don't do software development
 then this application may not
 be for you. Please take that
 into consideration before
 voting it down!

Usage
-----------------------------
 Please read the help as
 offered by the application

Rationale
-----------------------------
 I am having trouble syncing
 my contacts with google. As
 it seems to be working for
 everyone else, I can only
 assume that one or more
 contacts cause problems.
 That is why I needed a tool
 to export my contacts. That
 way I can manually edit them,
 re-import them onto the phone
 and then retry syncing.

 On the other hand this gives
 me a much friendlier format
 to work with, so I can clean
 up my contacts.
